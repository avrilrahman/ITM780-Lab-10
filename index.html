    <h1>SEO and SMO Techniques</h1>

    <p>SEO Keyword Research: This SEO technique involves identifying relevant keywords that users frequently search for and strategically integrating them into website content to enhance search engine visibility and relevance. I find this interesting because it is a powerful technique to leverage as it gives content more visibility to users for larger outreach. (Simplilearn, 2024).</p>

    <p>Metadata SEO Optimization: This technique involves optimizing HTML elements on websites which includes -- title tags, header tags, meta descriptions and more. This allows to show the user and search engines what the page is about accurately. This improves visibility and relevance. (Simplilearn, 2024).</p>

    <p>Internal Links for SEO: Internal linking for SEO involves connecting pages within your website through hyperlinks. This strategy helps search engines understand your site's structure and hierarchy while guiding users to related content, improving their navigation experience. (Semrush, 2024)</p>

    <p>Social Media Buttons for SMO: Adding social media media platforms that you have a presence on, allows user to connect with you in different spaces, which leads to larger outreach and following. Having social media buttons on the header or footer of your pages, allows users to find them with ease and also share your content on their social media accounts. (WebFX, 2024).</p>

    <p>Social Media Analytics: It is importantt to monitor your performance of your posts and social pages to see what methods are most effective for you. As well as, to improve your analytics by exploring different options after gaining crucial insights. You can monitor impressions, clicks, and engagements. (WebFX, 2024).</p>

    <p>Engagement Optimization: To improve your social media presence, you must post consistent and high-quality posts that your audience is interested in. Figure out the peak times your audience is most active and post at the right times to get results that you want. You can do this by checking your analytics dashboard to see when users are most active and tailor your weekly-planned posts. (Hootsuite, n.d.).</p>
